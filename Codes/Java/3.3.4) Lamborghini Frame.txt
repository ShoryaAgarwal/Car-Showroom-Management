The redesigned front and rear arches direct air around the car in order to reduce excessive lift and aid in generating downforce. The smooth underbody ensures that the airflow is not interrupted. The large carbon-fibre rear wing connected to the car via an LMP1 style central fin is three-way adjustable. The wheels of the car (measuring 20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the rear) have a turbine-like design and direct air to cool the car's carbon ceramic braking system. The central-locking hubs on the wheels allow for easy installation and removal.");
